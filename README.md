computer, device for processing, storing, and displaying information.
The first computers were used primarily for numerical calculations. However, as any information can be numerically encoded, people soon realized that computers are capable of general-purpose information processing. 
#A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

text is a human-readable sequence of character s and the words they form that can be encoded into computer-readable formats 

Text is usually distinguished from non-character encoded data, such as graphic images in the form of bitmap s and program code, which is sometimes referred to as being in "binary" (but is actually in its own computer-readable format).
